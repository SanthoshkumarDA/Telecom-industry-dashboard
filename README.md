# Telecom-industry-dashboard
What have I done?

I have found all the metrics for Atlioq Telecom.

I have worked with KPI.

I have compared the revenue and active users city wise to look out for the top performers.

I have found Total Revenue, Total ARPU, Total active subscribers, Total Unsubscribers.

I have also calculated the average of all the above.

Then I have found the trend of both revenue and active users compared with before and after 5G using a trend line.

I found that plans account for a large percentage of revenue.

Next, I have plotted the market share % of Atlioq with its competitors.
